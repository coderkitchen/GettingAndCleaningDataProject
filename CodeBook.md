The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.

#### Data attributes

`subject`
	An integer (1-30) indicating the ID of the subject
	
`activity`
	The activity performed by the subject.  Possible ctivities include (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
	
The remaining 66 attributes each represent the average value of the indicated measurement feature for a given subject and activity.  The feature names indicate the measurement using the following common syntax:

```
t - time domain signal
f - frequency domain signal

Body - Body motion component of the signal
Gravity - Gravity component of the signal

Acc - Acceleration from the accelerometer
Gyro - Velocity from the gyroscope

Jerk - derived in time from the body linear acceleration and angular velocity
Mag - magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm

mean - normalized mean value of feature
std - normalized standard deviation of feature

X - x axis
Y - y axis
Z - z axis
```
